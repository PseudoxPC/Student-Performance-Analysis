![IBM Logo](ibm_img.jpeg)  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project analyzes **academic scores and performance patterns** of students using **Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Power BI**.  
The goal is to uncover hidden insights, identify performance gaps, and provide educators with **data-driven strategies** to improve learning outcomes.  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Students’ academic achievements are influenced by multiple factors like:  
- Socio-economic status  
- Parental education  
- Test preparation courses  
- Lunch type  

However, identifying which factors impact performance the most is often challenging.  
This project applies **data analytics and visualization** techniques to answer these questions and build an **interactive dashboard**.
